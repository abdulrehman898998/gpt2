GPT-2 Model from Scratch and Fine-Tuning for Spam Detection
This project demonstrates how to build a GPT-2 model from scratch, fine-tune it for spam and ham classification, and deploy it as a Streamlit web app for real-time predictions. The model is also hosted on Hugging Face for easy access.

Project Overview
In this project, I built a GPT-2 language model from the ground up using the concepts outlined by Andrej Karpathy in his YouTube video on building transformer models from scratch. The model was then fine-tuned using a spam vs. ham dataset for text classification. After fine-tuning, I deployed the model as an interactive Streamlit web app where users can send text input and get real-time predictions on whether the text is spam or ham.

Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language for model building and fine-tuning.
TensorFlow/PyTorch: Frameworks used for model implementation.
Hugging Face: Platform for hosting the pre-trained model.
Streamlit: Framework for building the interactive web app.
NLP (Natural Language Processing): Techniques like tokenization, attention mechanisms, and transformer-based architectures.

Steps Involved
1. Building GPT-2 from Scratch
I started by implementing the GPT-2 model from scratch, focusing on:

Transformer architecture (attention mechanism, positional encoding, etc.).
Tokenization and creating input embeddings.
Layer stacking and model configuration for training.
2. Fine-Tuning on Spam and Ham Data
Used a publicly available spam vs. ham dataset to fine-tune the GPT-2 model.
Achieved 95% accuracy on the fine-tuned model for spam classification.
3. Streamlit App for Real-Time Predictions
Developed an interactive Streamlit web app to send text input and classify whether it's spam or ham.
The app connects to the trained model to make real-time predictions.
4. Model Deployment
The trained GPT-2 model is uploaded to Hugging Face and has been downloaded 50 times so far.
Shared the code for building and fine-tuning the model on this GitHub repository.
